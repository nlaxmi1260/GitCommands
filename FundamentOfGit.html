    <h3>Fundamentals of GIT</h3>
    <p>
        <p>
            <b>Git : </b> Git is a version control system also known as a VCS. This version control refers to the process of saving files or versions throughout the stages in life of a project where you can retrieve past versions at any time. Git gives you the ability to go back in time at any point during your development and see the work at that specific point in time. To do this, <b> Git tracks changes made to files in a project and creates a unique identifier to each change so that it's easily discoverable </b> if you ever want to go back and retrieve a version of the project or revert a change that you've made. You can also think of this as an autosave at a specific checkpoint that you can easily reference for your project. The great thing about Git is that you can version control nearly any type of file, not just source code files.

            <li>The Characteristics of Git</li>
            <p>
                Git isn't just a distributed version control, it's an advanced version control system that is incredibly <b>robust with commands and options </b> for you to perform that give you a lot of control over how your project is being tracked and maintained unlike other version control systems. Git does not track version changes as just a list fileâ€‘based changes between one version to another by only representing the changes to a base version of a file. These <b>version differences are commonly referred to as the deltas or diffs</b>. Instead, <b>Git stores each saved version of your project as a complete snapshot of the entire project's file system at that specific point in time and not just the files being modified and their deltas or diffs. This snapshot captures everything in the project, including its history and all of its metadata</b>.

                    <p>This snapshot concept is really important to understanding Git, just remember that Git tracks changes as a complete snapshot or picture of the project and not just the version deltas or the diffs.</p>
            </p>
            <li>Optimized for local development</li>
            <p>
                Now, what this means is that Git is a distributed version control system. We have a complete copy of the project and all of its history and metadata on our own local machine. So if the main version of our Git project is being hosted on let's say a remote server, which will be the case for nearly every Git project when working in a team environment, you can work disconnected from the main server since Git doesn't need a constant connection for you to work in the project. This gives you the ability to work completely offline and still be able to navigate the project and use Git. Then when you're online again, you have access to the remote server, you can push your changes up for everyone to see and also pull down any new changes that other team members have made.

            </p>
            <li>Git is Explicit</li>
            <p>Git won't perform any action without you clearly telling it what to do. So for example, Git won't automatically sync your local copy of the project with the main copy on the remote server unless you tell it to do so. Git also won't autosave your work or complete those snapshots, unless you explicitly tell Git to do it. Every Git action requires your explicit command or instruction. And so in short, you need to be intentional with your actions. At first, this may seem like a bottleneck, and you have to explicitly tell Git to do every little thing, but once you get the hang of things, you'll find that this level of interaction gives you complete freedom to tell Git when to do things, how to do things, and where to do it.</p>
